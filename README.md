# UI-UX-Project
Final Project for my UI/UX course  
  
## Create a Table Reservation Page ##  
  
### Defining the Problem ##  
The Little Lemon Restaurant does not have an online reserve-a-table feature making it difficult for customers to reserve a table without having to call the restaurant directly. A mobile reservation page must be created that allows the user to choose the date, time, number of guests, and contact information to create a seamless reservation experience.  
  
### Creating a Persona ###  
A fictional person was created that would represent the sites target users. They were designed with a photo, name, bio, core needs, and frustrations simulating a real person. The persona was used as the basis of the sites design and direction as well as a way to place the designer in a users shoes and see how they would use and navigate the website.

### User Journey Map ###  
A journey map is a document that follows the personas journey through the start of a designated task towards the end goal. In this situation the persona was tasked with reserving a table from the Little Lemon Restaurant website. The document follows along each step that the persona takes keeping note of what they are thinking and saying throughout the process. At the end of the journey any possible opportunitites for improvement are noted as well as steps that are needed to be done in order to achieve those improvements.
